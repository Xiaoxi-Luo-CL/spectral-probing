"This theory , along with other theories of correspondence in translating , are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence , where Nida begins by asserting that given that "" no two languages are identical , either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences , it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages .","det nsubj punct advmod case amod obl case nmod mark acl punct aux root case nmod obl appos case nmod punct advmod nsubj acl mark advcl mark advcl mark punct det nummod nsubj cop ccomp punct cc case det obl acl case amod obl cc case det conj case obl nsubj aux acl case obl cc conj punct expl ccomp case obl mark expl aux cop det amod csubj case nmod punct"
