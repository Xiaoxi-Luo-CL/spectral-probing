"We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 24 ] , all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral ( performance ) outcomes .","nsubj cop root case nummod obl acl mark advcl det obj case det amod nmod case amod nmod acl compound compound obj punct dep punct punct punct conj punct punct punct conj punct case punct nmod punct punct nsubj case nmod aux acl case det obl case amod punct appos punct nmod punct"

"The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure , mainly on general language skills [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] or lexical abilities [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .","det nummod nsubj root compound obj case obl case nummod nmod case nummod nmod case amod compound nmod punct advmod case amod compound obl punct dep punct punct punct conj punct punct punct conj punct punct punct conj punct punct punct conj punct punct advmod advmod case advmod amod obl acl mark xcomp obj case amod nmod punct dep punct punct punct conj punct cc amod conj punct dep punct punct punct conj punct punct"

"A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition ( loss ) of L2 performance or knowledge [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ] .","det nsubj case amod nmod advmod root case obl punct appos punct case compound nmod cc conj punct dep punct punct punct conj punct punct punct conj punct punct punct conj punct punct"
"Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure , e.g. , after a 1 - 7 month [ 23 ] or 6 month delay [ 21 ] , as well as after 2 years [ 18 ] , though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5 years , and not earlier [ 17 ] .","amod nsubj aux aux root case advmod obl case det amod obl case amod nmod punct advmod punct case det nummod case nmod compound punct dep punct cc nummod conj obl punct dep punct punct cc fixed fixed case nummod conj punct dep punct punct mark case nummod obl nsubj aux advcl advmod case nummod case nmod obl punct cc advmod conj punct dep punct punct"

"Finally , in some cases a gain in performance has been observed : after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study , particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [ 24 ] , and in another study after 2 years , though only for some abilities , such as listening and reading comprehension [ 18 ] .","advmod punct case det obl det nsubj case nmod aux aux root punct case nummod obl case amod nmod case nummod obl punct advmod case compound obl case nmod cc fixed fixed compound conj punct dep punct punct cc case det conj case nummod orphan punct advmod advmod case det orphan punct case fixed compound cc conj nmod punct dep punct punct"
